Location coordinates (x,y) based in a imaginery world measuring 1000m x 1000m. Note that (0<=x<1000, 0<=y<1000)
The world is divided into 10 by 10 grid where each is indexed from 0. The x grid coordinate is converted to letter (A, B, C).
Implement a function for coordinates (x,y) which will retunr a string of x-coordinate expressed as a letter, and y coordinate as a number betweeen 1 and 10.

i.e for x=0, y=0 would be 'A1' and x=999, y=999 would be 'J10'.
